# Crab Simulator 1.4

Crab Simulator was originally Ant Simulator, built in Python by my friend [Jacob](https://github.com/SaladTheGreat42/). I essentially remade it to learn the Python language freshman year of high school, calling it Crab Simulator and taking on a new, nautical theme. We joined forces to release the original Crab Simulator for Python, distributed via Windows executable, and I ported it to the web so I could put it on my website.

Since then, we've started the long and arduous journey of making Crab Simulator 2. Will it ever come out? I'm not sure at this point. But maybe.
